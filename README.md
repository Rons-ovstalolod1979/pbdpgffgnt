Omg, just finished watching Alarum and I've got so many feels, but also my brain's kinda mush right now, lol. You know what I mean? Like, dude, the plot had me spiraling in like 15 different directions. I couldn't even guess where it was going! Seriously, does anyone know? üòÜ

> So, there was this one scene, and if you've seen the movie, you know exactly which one I'm talking about, where I legit thought my brain was gonna explode. I can't even begin to describe the wild rollercoaster of emotions I felt. One minute I was like, nah, there's no way, and the next, BOOM, major plot twist. 

And can we just talk about the soundtrack for a sec? Whoever picked those tracks deserves an award or something because they fit like a glove. I actually downloaded the movie just to hear those songs again. Well, also to catch all the stuff I missed the first time, and trust me, there's plenty.

Also, characters were on point! Even the ones I thought were kinda meh at first totally grew on me. And the main villain? Absolute legend. Why do they always make the bad guys the most interesting ones? It's unfair, really.

I swear, the movie was such a trip. I feel like I should watch the movie again just to wrap my head around everything. It‚Äôs like when you lose your phone, then find it in the weirdest place ever... you just gotta go through it again to understand, right? üòÖ

Oh! And those special effects! I can't get over how cool they looked. I mean, some of them were a bit over the top, but then again, it's a movie, so why not go full extra? I'd legit love to know who sits in those creative meetings like, Hey, what if we make everything explode at once?

int randomFunction(){ return 42; } // bruh, why did I even add this?

Anyway, I‚Äôm gonna crash now. My brain's like, plz stop. But yeah, if you haven't seen it, seriously check it out when you can. Sleeping might be tricky after all that adrenaline but who cares, right? We'll talk more about it later, alright? ‚úåÔ∏è
